# React Portfolio

Hey there! I'm Anthony, a new enthusiastic web dev. I built this portfolio site to show you what I can do and to tell you a little bit more about myself than this read me will.

# Features

## About Page

A short summary of my skills and more about me!

## Project Page

The project page allows you to see some projects that I'm proud of and keep up with my latest work. I may be enhancing this site with a database to more easily update viewers on what projects I'm currently working on.

## Contact Page

This site is very simple but does boast an emailing service through the contact page. This will allow you to send emails to a specific email that I've set up to handle portfolio inqueries.
